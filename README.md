# My Home Assistant Configuration
I'm often behind on updating the readme. Ask me about anything!
My configuration is broken down into [packages](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/README.md), sort of mini configuration-files. This makes it easy to see everything pertaining to a specific automation or implementation.

### Running Hass.io on an Intel Nuc with Ubuntu Server, in docker.
* Running a slave instance of Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a 16 gb memory card, since Hass.io can't use the Intel Nuc built in bluetooth (hoping for support soon!).
* Using native Homekit component to get support for Homekit and Siri.
* Using Home Assistant Cloud for Alexa.
#### Add-ons
* IDE
* MariaDB
* Mosquitto broker

* Terminal

## Hubs
* Zwave: Aeon Labs Z Wave Stick (GEN 5)

### Presence-detection
* Ios-app for Hass
* Nmap
* BT tracking
* Homekit
* Automations and python script to put information from above trackers together

## Automation hall of fame
### My favorite automations
* [Sending notifications when we get mail or packages in mailbox](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/mailbox.yaml)
* [Setting air cleaner in bedroom to quiet at 9 pm (before bedtime) and auto at 11 am (when we are sure to have gotten out of bed), using Broadlink RM3 mini ir blaster](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/air_cleaner.yaml)
* [Set light status on a few lights inside and Outdoor based on time of day,](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/lights_in_morning.yaml) [sun](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/dark_lights_on.yaml) [and when we come home](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/lights_at_presence.yaml)
* [Xiaomi switch by the bed toggles bedside lamp (single press), bedroom ceiling light (double press) or dim and brighten bedside lamp (long press)](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/bedroom_lights.yaml)
* [Not smart Roomba only vacuums when we're not home, starts using Broadlink RM3 mini ir blaster](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/roomba.yaml)
* [Monitoring and notifications when washer](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/laundry_washing_machine.yaml) [and dryer are done](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/laundry_dryer.yaml)
* [Say good morning to Siri and she turns on a couple of lights, and turns on the morning show on the living room tv if it's a work day](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/good_morning.yaml)
* [Say goodnight and all lights turn off, the bedside lamp and Xiaomi gw nightlight turns on, air cleaner gets quiet command and alarm goes to night mode](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/goodnight.yaml)
* [When someone uses the Ring Doorbell, flash lights in backyard and upstairs hallway](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/ring_doorbell.yaml)
* [Notifications for cleaning cat litterboxes](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/litterbox_upstairs.yaml)

## Future plans:
* Setting up a Magic mirror with information from Hass
* Setting up Floorplan on tablets

## Examples from my Lovelace gui
### I have tried to make a gui that is mobile first, since that's how I most often look at it
