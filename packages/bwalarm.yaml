  ##[CODE RELATED]
  #[REQUIRED] Master Code, should consist of one or more digits ie '6482' ensure your passcode is encapsulated by quotes
  code: !secret alarm_control_panel_code
  #[OPTIONAL] Panic Code should consist of one or more digits ie '9876' ensure your passcode is encapsulated by quotes, it needs to be different to your standard alarm code. This enables a special panic mode. This can be used under duress to deactivate the alarm which would appear to the unseeing eye as deactivated however a special attribute [panic_mode] listed under the alarm_control_panel.[identifier] will change to ACTIVE. This status could be used in your automations to send a notification to someone else police/spouse/sibling/neighbour that you are under duress. To deactive this mode arm then disarm your alarm in the usual manner. 
  panic_code: !secret alarm_control_panel_panic_code
  
  #[DEFAULT] Grace time in seconds to allow for exit and entry using Away mode
  pending_time: 60
